## ⚖️ Rules & Guidelines

### 1. Constellation Point System

Each team is allocated a total of **9 points** to spend on **limited 5-star characters with constellations**.  
Standard 5-stars and all 4-star characters **do not consume points** and are free to use.

| Constellation Level | Point Cost | Notes |
|----------------------|-------------|--------|
| C6 (Constellation 6) | 5 Points | One limited 5★ character |
| C2–C5                | 2 Points | One limited 5★ character |
| C1                   | 1 Point | One limited 5★ character |

**Notes:**
- Teams may distribute their 9 points freely.  
- It is not mandatory to use all points.  
- The 9-point cap cannot be exceeded under any circumstances.  
- Characters without constellations or those from the **standard banner** are exempt from the point system.

### 2. Character Level Restrictions

- Characters **above Level 90** (i.e., Level 95 or Level 100) are **not allowed**.

---

### 4. Draft Preparation Guidelines
- Non-captain participants are required to update their in-game profiles to showcase their top characters for preview during the team draft.

---

### 3. Team Draft Format

The tournament will use **Captain Mode** drafting with the following pick order:

| Round | Draft Order |
|--------|--------------|
| 1 | A ➡️ B ➡️ C ➡️ D |
| 2 | B ➡️ C ➡️ D ➡️ A |
| 3 | C ➡️ D ➡️ A ➡️ B |

**Notes:**
- Teams **A to D** will be **randomly assigned** prior to the draft.  
- At the end of the draft, players may opt to swap a team member with another captain, provided both members are within the same score bracket and no more than one other captain objects to the swap.

---

### 4. Team Composition

- Each team must consist of **at least two players** to ensure continuity in case of player withdrawal.  

---

### 5. Progress Tracking

- During the event, players must **submit a screenshot** of their current clear time to the **Tournament Organizer (TO)** as a progress update.  

---

### 6. Substitutions & Player Availability

If a team member becomes unable to continue due to travel, account issues, or other valid reasons, the following options apply:

#### • Account Pilot  
A substitute (“import”) player may pilot the unavailable player’s account, provided the team agrees and tournament integrity is maintained.

#### • Player Replacement  
A new player may permanently replace the unavailable team member.  
This substitution must be proposed to all current participants and will only be allowed if **approved by a majority vote**.

#### • Team Continuation  
Teams are permitted to continue with **two active players** without requiring a replacement.
